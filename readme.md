# Solving N-Queens problem using GA

This uses the evolution algorithm to find a solution for N-queens problem.

The queens are presented as a list. Since the board is N by N, a sampel 8 queens board would be like:

`[1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 4, 5]`

Each ith index from 0 to 7 represents the column on the board. Each jth number on ith index represents the row number of queen on board.

For example: The queen on 2nd column is on 4th row in the board.
